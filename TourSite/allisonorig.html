<h4 class="emdr__title">EMDR</h4>
<p class="emdr__paragraph">Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is  a powerful and effective therapy for the treatment of trauma. Symptoms of trauma can occur  after an emotional or physical event that overtaxes our nervous system, causing high levels of distress. Left untreated, trauma can manifest in symptoms such as depression, anxiety, addictive behaviors, creativity blocks, and relationship difficulties.</p>
<p class="emdr__paragraph">EMDR is an integrative approach that provides healing from disturbing images, debilitating emotions, and restrictive beliefs by directly impacting the way the brain processes information. Similar to what occurs naturally during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, EMDR activates the REM processing system in the brain  to access memory networks and release the emotional charge associated with distressing thoughts and memories. Treatment consists of bilateral stimulation, through sound or touch, which activates alternate sides of the brain. This process allows for the release of distressing emotional experiences held in the body and mind.</p>
<p class="emdr__paragraph">As EMDR treatment addresses the source of distress, it is extremely effective in treating even the most problematic issues in a relatively short amount of time, often resulting in fewer sessions than talk therapy. As a fully trained and certified EMDR therapist, I have used this technique to treat the psychological effects of both large and small-scale traumas. My expertise allows me to safely direct you through the entire process until you are feeling less troubled and ultimately at peace.</p>

<h4>Individual Therapy</h4>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Many seek therapy for help with issues that are hard to face alone, out of a desire to improve the quality of their life. Therapy can help people overcome obstacles to their well-being by learning strategies to express themselves, heal from painful experiences, and gain practical skills to manage difficult feelings and situations.</p>

I have worked with individuals with a wide range of presenting concerns and focus on treating </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">anxiety, depression, phobias, relationship issues, addictive behaviors, and trauma.

<h4>Couples Therapy</h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Couples therapy can help to resolve a current problem or serve as support for a happy couple experiencing a period of stress or transition. Common areas of concern addressed in couples therapy include frequent conflict, money, sex, infidelity, parenting, chronic health issues, infertility, substance use, trauma, and emotional disconnection.  Couples therapy can be beneficial for any kind of romantic relationship, whether partners are straight, gay, young, old, dating, engaged, or married.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I provide couples therapy for a wide variety of relational issues for couples who are looking to improve their relationship. I have clinical experience working relationally to help a couple gain insight into their relationship and improve their emotional connection utilizing a variety of techniques. I provide a supportive environment that helps both partners explore their problems from a new perspective, while also incorporating practical tools to recognize and resolve conflicts, resulting in improved communication and connection. Based on the belief that trust is built through genuine authenticity, my counseling style is collaborative, active, and empathic.</span>
